Notice that it (almost) not profitable to purchase additional 
plum tomatos. 

Additional Beef tomatos are worth more in the winter.

It seems like tomatos in general are worth more in the winter.

Maybe something with preservation for winter?

i.e. In summer we are not limited by availability of tomatos
but in Winter we are?
